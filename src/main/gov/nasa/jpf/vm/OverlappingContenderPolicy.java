/**
 * a thread tracking policy that uses ThreadInfoSets which are
 * search global from the point of object creation. Each object
 * allocation gets a new ThreadInfo set which contains only the
 * allocating thread. 
 * 
 * Note this can miss sharedness due to non-overlapping thread execution.
 * Most real world systems have enough interaction points (sync,
 * field access within loops etc.) to avoid this, but short living threads
 * that only have single field access interaction points can run into
 * this effect: T1 creates O, creates & starts T2, accesses O and terminates
 * before T2 runs. When T2 runs, it only sees access to O from an already
 * terminated thread and therefore treats this as a clean handover. Even if
 * T2 would break at the access, there is no CG that would bring T1 back
 * into the state between creation and access of O, hence T1 never breaks
 * on that access.
 * Unfortunately, this case has a tendency to happen in simple race examples
