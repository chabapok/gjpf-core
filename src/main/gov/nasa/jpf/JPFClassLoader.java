/**
 * this is the class loader we use if JPF is started via  gov.nasa.jpf.Main
 * the purpose is to add whatever is configured in the site.properties or
 * an explicit "+native_classpath" setting to the class path, in addition to
 * JPF required libraries that were not specified when invoking Main
 *
 * the twist is that jpf core classes will be accessible through the
 * classpath of whatever loaded Main *and* this JPFClassLoader, hence we can't
 * go with the standard parent-first delegation model. If we do, all core
 * classes will be loaded by the current CL, which then is not able to resolve
 * references that require core libs (which were not in the CP).
 *
 * The solution is to reverse the lookup order, but filter out all JPF classes we
 * know have been already loaded (including JPFClassLoader itself).
 *
 * The second trick is that we base this on an extended URLClassLoader, so that
 * JPF at runtime can determine if it should automatically extend the set
 * of CP URLS. Initially, we only have the JPF core in there (deduced from
 * the JPF CP element of the current CL)
