 * an abstract class that creates Event trees
 * 
 * While there is no need to provide specialized Event types or compound constructors

 * 
 *   public Event createEventTree1() {
 *     return sequence(
 *             event("a"),
 *             alternatives(
 *                     event("1"),
 *                     iteration(2,
 *                             event("x")
 *                     )
